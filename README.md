# noclMameHub
 noclMamehub is a GUI made in C using GTK+ 3. It works with an old version of MameHub (MAMEHub 0.201) emulator made by MisterTea.
 I did this GUI just to learn how to use GTK+ and Glade together with CSS, but since it works (even though there are huge problems and unnecessary code), I decided to upload it here.
First thing I ever developed, will let this here to see how much I evolve with time...
